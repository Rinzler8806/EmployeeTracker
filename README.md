# Employee Tracker

## Instructions

The following application is designed with the intention of managing an employee database. The user can do the following:
add (roles, departments, and employees)
delete (roles, departments and employees)
update employee roles.

When adding roles the user will be able to classify the name of the role, as well as the salary of the specific role and what department it is under.
When adding employees the user will be able to classify the employee by first name, last name, role, and manager.

Simply open the app in the terminal and navigate using the arrow keys. 
When selecting a specific field, the user will be prompted as applicable to their selection (for example: selecting 'add employee' will prompt questions asking the first name, last name, role, and manager in which the user would input. Selecting to view an employee, would simply show the user the list of employees.) Enjoy!
